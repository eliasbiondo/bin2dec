<b> Bin2Dec </b> is an open source javascript vanilla web app that allow the user to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers and vice-versa! You can test it [clicking here](https://eliasbiondo.github.io/bin2dec/) or open the lastest deployed version on [https://eliasbiondo.github.io/bin2dec/](https://eliasbiondo.github.io/bin2dec/). 

<b>Why?</b> I've decided to create this app to practice my html, css and javascript skills. Seeing similar applications at the web, I've seen that few websites have a good design or interesting features how a history to save values on local storage for future consulting. I belive a powerful binary to decimal calculator could be useful many times.
